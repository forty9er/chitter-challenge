# @Chitter.

### Duration

2 days


### Live demo

https://cryptic-citadel-4502.herokuapp.com/


### Installation

Download the files in the repo, install the required Gems and run via a Sinatra server via Rackup on your local machine. You will also need a working PostgreSQL installation (you can install this via Brew).
The main controller is 'app.rb' in the 'app' directory. You will need a Ruby interpreter (if you are running OS X you already have this) and RVM installed.

To clone the repo on your machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/forty9er/chitter_challenge
```

Then from the root folder, install the Gems, create and initialise the database and finally run the app:
```
$ bundle
$ createdb chitter_development
$ rake db:auto_migrate RACK_ENV=development
$ rackup app/config.ru
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:9292/ in your browser.


### Usage

You can view 'Peeps' simply by navigating to the website, or by clicking on the "@Chitter" logo.

### Testing

The app was built using TDD. Before running you will need to initialize the test database:

```
rake db:auto_migrate RACK_ENV=test
```

RSpec tests can be run from the root directory simply by running:

```
rspec
```


###Â TODO

* Responsive (Bootstrap) styling (larger buttons, position elements, logo and backdrop.)
* Consider using partials.
* Consider whether controllers can be slimmed down further.
* Use view helpers to remove amount of embedded Ruby and comply with SRP.
* Correct semantics for HTML form markup.
* Use article etc. not div in HTML.
* Integrate tagging other users to create conversations.
* Rake task for first DB setup.
* More comprehensive feature testing.


### Technologies used
